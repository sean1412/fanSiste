	    <h1>The 6 playable characters</h1>
	    <a id="#top"></a><p>There are 6 different playable characters in the game. Axton, Maya, Salvador, Zer0, Gaiga, Krieg these athe 6 characters.Gaiga and Krieg are downloadable characters so you don't need them to enjoy the game but it gives a different game play.Each characters have a different set of skills and abilitys.Axton has a turret that you can customize. He's like the leader of the group. Maya is the siren of the group. she's plays the medic role. Her special is using her siren powers to trap, kill, and control enemies. The heavy gunner is Salvador. He can duel wield any two guns. In my mind I think he's a broken character because he's so op with this skill. My favorite character Zer0 he's the sniper or assassin. His skill is Decepti0n, where he can go invisible for 5 seconds to either get away or do a sneak attack. The 2 downloadable characters, Gaige the mechromancer. She's the tech savy character of the group. Her skill is that she can summan a big killer robot named Deathtrap. And the last character the melee Krieg. His skill is he turns into a mutant and he uses a big buzzz axe. With all these characters there cool, funny, nice, etc NPC to talk to and get quest from.<a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>
